Snow In Tokyo
=============

Source code and exploratory work for the music video for "Snow In Tokyo" by DEADBEAR: http://www.deadbear.co.uk

Live-coded using Cyril, an environment built in OpenFrameworks by Darren Mothersele: https://github.com/darrenmothersele/cyril

Project structure:
------------------
COMPONENTS contains isolated single examples of various techniques used in this project. This is mostly a scratchpad for experiments and small pieces of exploratory work that have gone into the final phases.

PHASES contains the actual code that creates each visual layer of the piece. Phases are currently stored as directories, as Cyril accepts up to nine text files (formatted as "0.txt", "1.txt" and so on) for each of the nine working areas in the environment. The first is a scratchpad for colours and constants, and is based on a common template (this may deviate in some phases though). Each phase also contains a preview image of what it typically looks like while running.
